# Rhythm AI â€“ Multi-Cloud Deployment Patterns

## What

- Deploy models to AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI, Azure ML, or any cloud.
- Full audit of every deployment, region, and artifact.

## Example

```python
from orchestration.cloud_deploy import deploy_to_cloud

deploy_to_cloud("aws-prod")
deploy_to_cloud("gcp-prod")
deploy_to_cloud("azure-prod")
```

- In production: use each cloud provider's SDK for upload, registration, and endpoint creation.
- Integrate into CI/CD for automatic model promotion.
