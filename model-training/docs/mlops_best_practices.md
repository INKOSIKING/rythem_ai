# Rhythm AI MLOps & Production Best Practices

- **Use CI/CD** (`.github/workflows/`) to automate training, evaluation, and artifact upload.
- **Track data and models with DVC** for reproducibility and auditability.
- **Log metrics to W&B or MLflow** for every experiment.
- **Monitor resource usage** (`utils/monitoring.py`) for cost and performance.
- **Store artifacts in S3/GCS/Cloud** for safety and scalability.
- **Quantize and export models** for efficient deployment (`onnx_quantization.py`).
- **Automate deployment** of ONNX models using `serve_inference.py`, Docker, and K8s.
- **Validate** with robust test sets and automated evaluation scripts.
- **Document** every step for team knowledge and onboarding.

## Example: End-to-end Workflow

1. `git push` triggers CI/CD.
2. Data tracked/processed with DVC.
3. Model trained, evaluated, and logged to W&B/MLflow.
4. Best checkpoint uploaded to S3/GCS.
5. Model exported to ONNX, quantized, and deployed to API servers.
6. Resource usage and inference times monitored in production.
