# Rhythm AI â€“ Advanced MLOps Roadmap

## Next Steps

- **Registry UI enhancements:** add approval/reject buttons, display audit/rollback history, search and filter.
- **Closed-loop retraining:** auto-trigger retraining when new labeled data arrives or drift is detected.
- **Model canary/batch rollout:** deploy new models to a subset of traffic, monitor, then promote or rollback.
- **Fine-grained access control:** per-model, per-user permissions for registry actions.
- **Explainability & fairness monitoring:** integrate SHAP, LIME, and bias/fairness dashboards.
- **Federated & privacy-preserving training:** enable secure, decentralized learning.
- **Multi-cloud, hybrid, and edge deployment:** orchestrate across any infra.
- **Automated compliance exports:** schedule periodic sending of audit/compliance logs to regulators.
