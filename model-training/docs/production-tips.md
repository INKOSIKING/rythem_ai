# Rhythm AI Production Training & Deployment Tips

- Use `launch_distributed.py` for multi-GPU, multi-node training.
- Use `data_augmentation.py` for robust, generalizable audio/music models.
- Log everything to Weights & Biases and/or MLflow for reproducibility.
- Store checkpoints in S3/GCS using `cloud_storage.py` or `s3_storage.py`.
- Quantize ONNX models for real-time inference on CPU/mobile (`onnx_quantization.py`).
- Use `serve_inference.py` to deploy your model as a scalable web API.
- Monitor and autoscale with Kubernetes or serverless platforms for production.
- Always validate your data pipeline and model outputs with `evaluate.py` and real world test sets.
