# Rhythm AI – Security Best Practices

## Secrets Management

- Use Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, or cloud secret managers for all credentials
- Never commit secrets to Git
- Rotate secrets regularly

## Network Security

- Restrict API/service access with Kubernetes network policies
- Use HTTPS for all endpoints (Ingress/LoadBalancer)
- Enforce authentication on inference endpoints (JWT, OAuth)

## Container/Image Security

- Use minimal, non-root images (as in `Dockerfile.inference`)
- Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities (Trivy, Clair)
- Enable image signing and verification

## Data Security

- Encrypt all data at rest (S3, GCS, PVCs)
- Enable audit logging for data and model access
- Ensure proper IAM/RBAC for all storage/cloud resources

## Supply Chain Security

- Pin all dependency versions and scan regularly
- Use Dependabot/GitHub Security Alerts for automated patching
- Require signed commits for production
