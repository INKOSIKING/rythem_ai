# Rhythm AI Training Automation & MLOps

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

- Automates training and evaluation on every push.
- Artifacts (model checkpoints, logs) are uploaded for reproducibility.
- Can be extended to auto-deploy ONNX models or retrain on new datasets.

## DVC for Data & Experiment Versioning

- Add raw/processed datasets with DVC for full data reproducibility.
- Track experiment outputs (models/checkpoints, logs, eval metrics).
- Supports remote storage (S3, GCS, Azure, SSH, etc).

### Example DVC Commands

```bash
dvc init
dvc add datasets/processed
dvc add models/checkpoints
dvc remote add -d myremote s3://rhythm-ai-dvc
dvc push
dvc pull
```

## Example Workflow

1. **Preprocess data:**  
   `dvc repro preprocess`

2. **Train model:**  
   `dvc repro train`

3. **Evaluate and compare:**  
   `dvc repro evaluate`

4. **Share / collaborate:**  
   `dvc push` and `git push`
