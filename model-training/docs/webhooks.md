# Rhythm AI â€“ Webhook Trigger & Automation

## What

- Trigger external systems, CI/CD, or notification services on any MLOps event (deployment, model approval, SLA breach, etc).
- Fully audit-logged for traceability.

## Example

```python
from orchestration.webhook_trigger import trigger_webhook

trigger_webhook("model_deployed", {"model": "melodygen", "version": "1.0.3"}, "https://your.webhook/endpoint")
```

- Use for Slack alerts, PagerDuty, message queues, or custom automations.
- Integrate with approval, deployment, or registry workflows.

*Webhooks connect your MLOps system to the rest of your enterprise stack.*
