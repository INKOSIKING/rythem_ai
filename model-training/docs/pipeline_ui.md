# Rhythm AI â€“ Pipeline UI & Dashboard Patterns

## What

- Visualize and manage the full MLOps pipeline: model registry, jobs, deployments, audit, explainability, etc.
- Provide self-service for data scientists, ops, and compliance.

## Example (Stub)

```python
from orchestration.pipeline_ui_stub import show_pipeline_ui

show_pipeline_ui()
```

- In production, build with Streamlit, Dash, Gradio, or your web stack.
- Integrate with audit/log export for compliance and reporting.

*A modern UI brings your MLOps platform to life for every stakeholder.*
