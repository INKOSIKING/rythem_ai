# Rhythm AI – Enterprise Model Registry Patterns

## Integration Patterns

- **MLflow Registry Integration:**  
  Use the MLflow Python API to register artifacts and metadata alongside the file-based registry for advanced UI and search.
- **SageMaker Model Registry:**  
  Sync model artifacts and metadata to SageMaker Model Registry for enterprise deployment and compliance.
- **GCP Vertex AI Model Registry:**  
  Use the Vertex AI SDK to upload models and metadata to GCP for scalable serving and audit.

## Example: MLflow Registry Integration

```python
import mlflow
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("https://mlflow.example.com")
result = mlflow.register_model(
    "runs:/<run_id>/model",
    "RhythmAI-MelodyGen"
)
```

## Advanced Search and Audit

- Built-in registry supports advanced search (by metrics, tags, dates)
- All registry operations can be audited (see `audit_registry_ops.py`)
- Use Git versioning on `model_registry/` for full lineage and rollback

## Model Promotion Workflows

- "Staging" → "Production" via registry version bump and GitOps
- Track every promotion, rollback, and patch in audit logs

*For strict compliance, use append-only object storage and enterprise registry with automated audit exports.*
