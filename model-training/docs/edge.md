# Rhythm AI â€“ Multi-Cloud, Hybrid, and Edge Deployment

## What

- Deploy trained models to any environment: cloud, on-prem, edge devices, IoT.
- Audit every deployment for compliance and traceability.

## Example: Edge Deployment

```python
from orchestration.edge_deploy import deploy_to_edge

deploy_to_edge("edge-01")
deploy_to_edge("edge-02")
```

- In production, use SSH, SFTP, Ansible, or cloud/IoT deployment APIs.
- Integrate with GitOps, CI/CD, or MLOps orchestrators for automated rollouts.

*Hybrid and edge AI: faster, more private, and always in control.*
