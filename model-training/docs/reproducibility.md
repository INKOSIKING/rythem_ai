# Rhythm AI â€“ Reproducibility & Audit Trail

## Best Practices

- **Set random seed** in all libraries (`random`, `numpy`, `torch`) for every run.
- **Log all environment details** (`utils/reproducibility.py`) for each experiment.
- **Track all data, code, and config changes** with DVC + Git.
- **Register all models with metadata** in the model registry (metrics, config, timestamp).
- **Save evaluation results** and logs as artifacts in CI/CD.

## Example

```python
from utils.reproducibility import set_seed, log_env_info

set_seed(1337)
log_env_info()
```
